More Black Theme
================

Just like the Darcula theme, but replacing a lot of the grey backgrounds with black (not toolbars, or ), and
a brighter white for text.  Overall it's a dark theme with more contrast than Darcula.</p>

Mostly this was inspired by me always copying darcula editor scheme and setting the background to
black.  Then installing ColorIDE plugin to get other panes the same.  Unfortunately that isn't working
anymore, so this theme is born.

If you don't quite want it black, there's a theme called Darcula (Blacker) that's a little less than black.
